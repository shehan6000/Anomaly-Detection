# Anomaly-Detection

## Overview
In this project, we'll build an anomaly detection system using Pinecone for indexing and searching embeddings generated by the Sentence Transformers model. We'll train the model on a dataset of text pairs and then use it to encode and search through log samples to detect anomalies.
